This repository consists of 2 projects. The multiarm bandit project takes inputs from our uni server and so is not available. We calculate the reward and regret from collecting points from the arms available to our study and determine which algorithm is the best to obtain the least regret and highest reward.

Second project is to estimate the demand curve based on the data collected from a wet market by observing which variables should be the endogenous and exogenous variables for the study.
